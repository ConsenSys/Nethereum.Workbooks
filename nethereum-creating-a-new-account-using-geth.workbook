## Creating a new Account using Geth Personal Api

First we need to add a package reference to Nethereum.Web3. This package includes the base Personal management apis as it standard across clients.

```csharp
#r "Nethereum.Web3"
```

## Prerequisites:

Download the test chain from <https://github.com/Nethereum/Nethereum.Workbooks/tree/master/testchain/clique>.

Start the chain using startgeth.bat (Windows) or startgeth.sh (Mac/Linux). The chain is setup with the Proof of Authority consensus, will start the mining process inmediatly by unlocking the account “ 0x12890d2cce102216644c59daE5baed380d84830c”

```csharp
using Nethereum.Web3;
```

We will add the Nethereum.Web3 namespace, and we will create a new instance of Web3

```csharp
var web3 = new Web3();
```

Using the Personal Api we can now execute the request NewAccount with the password to encrypt the account storage file.

```csharp
var account = await web3.Personal.NewAccount.SendRequestAsync("password");
```
