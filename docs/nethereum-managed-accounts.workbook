# Using Nethereum managed accounts

Documentation about Nethereum can be found at: <https://nethereum.readthedocs.io>

First, let's download the test chain matching your environment from <https://github.com/Nethereum/Testchains>

Start a Geth chain (geth-clique-linux\\, geth-clique-windows\\ or geth-clique-mac\\) using **startgeth.bat** (Windows) or **startgeth.sh** (Mac/Linux). The chain is setup with the Proof of Authority consensus and will start the mining process immediately.

As usual, letâ€™s start setting up the environment by adding the Nethereum.Web3 and nuget package and using statements to Nethereum classes:

```csharp
#r "Nethereum.Web3"
```

Clients retrieve the private key for an account (if stored on their keystore folder) using a password provided to decrypt the file. This is done when unlocking an account, or just at the time of sending a transaction if using personal\_sendTransaction with a password.

Having an account unlocked for a certain period of time might be a security issue, so the prefered option in this scenario, is to use the rpc method personal\_sendTransaction.

```csharp
var senderAddress = "0x12890d2cce102216644c59daE5baed380d84830c";
var password = "password";
```

```csharp
var account = new ManagedAccount(senderAddress, password);
var web3 = new Web3.Web3(account);
```
