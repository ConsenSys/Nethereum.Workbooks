## Prerequisites:

Download the test chain matching your environment from https://github.com/Nethereum/Testchains

Start a Geth chain ( **geth-clique-linux\_** **_geth-clique-windows_** **_geth-clique-mac_**) using startgeth.bat (Windows) or startgeth.sh (Mac/Linux). The chain is setup with the Proof of Authority consensus and will start the mining process immediately.

First add the necessary namespaces and using statements (ie: #r "Nethereum.Web3", using Nethereum.Web3).
